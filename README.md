### What does it do?

- Documents best practice for automated provisioning of TLS Server Certificates to NMOS APIs.

### Why does it matter?

- A secure control plane is essential.
  - Certificates are an important part of this, and automation makes their use practical.
- These recommendations allow interoperability using widely adopted open technologies.

### How does it work?

- Recommends behaviour, based on Enrollment over Secure Transport (RFC 7030)
- Encryption is a prerequisite (see BCP-003-01).
